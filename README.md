# Data-Classification
This code is written by Mehrnaz Niazi and it loads a CSV file containing COVID-19 data. The dataset containing 11000 data points which can be downloaded from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset" provided on Kaggle. The code performs preprocessing on the data by mapping certain values. Then it selects the top 10 features using the SelectKBest method and visualizes the counts of each feature. It then one-hot encodes the target column and splits the data into training and test sets. The code defines three different functions to train and evaluate three different types of neural networks: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It then calls each of these functions to train and evaluate the corresponding neural network on the data.
